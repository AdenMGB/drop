# Contributing
Welcome! We're very happy to have people along with us to help creating Drop.

The best way to get started is by browsing our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Drop-OSS/drop/issues).

## Etiquette
It might not be the most enjoyable part, but we're trying to foster a good community around Drop.

1. **Be respectful**. We're all doing our best, so please, think before you say anything. Criticism is fine, welcome even. But don't go out of your way to make someone's day worse.
2. **Don't ping anyone without a reason**. People only have a limited amount of time in their day, so unless it's either urgent or very specific to someone, keep the pings down.
3. **Just use common sense**. If you wouldn't do it to another repo, then don't do it here. Any questions can be asked either in discussions or in the [discord](https://discord.gg/ZVGggfXN)
